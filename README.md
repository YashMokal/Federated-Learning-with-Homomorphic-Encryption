# Federated-Learning-with-Homomorphic-Encryption
Federated Learning: set-up for training machine learning algorithms on data without the owner having to share, transfer or expose their data with the developer and service provider.
1) Cross-device Federated Learning: multiple (millions) of devices used to train model of their respective data.
2) Cross-Silo Federated Learning: multiple devices/institutions not want to share their data, so train model on the device with federated learning.
Federated Analytics: works on private data science on remote data.

process to run the model:
1) install and import required libraries listed in the code
2) upload and load tabular dataset (.csv file)
3) run the model and observe results outputs and its accuracy, precision, recall and other parameters.
4) do same on encrypted model to train model over encrypted dataset
5) repeat step '3' ( run the model and observe results outputs and its accuracy, precision, recall and other parameters)

The complete details of the observation is provided in the report (PFA)
